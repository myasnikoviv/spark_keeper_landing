🔥 Spark Keeper

Technical Task — Landing Page Development

⸻

1. Project Goal

Create a high-converting promotional landing page for Spark Keeper — an AI-powered personal knowledge app that helps people capture, organize, connect, and turn scattered thoughts into actions.

The landing page must:
	•	Clearly articulate the user’s real-life problem
	•	Show Spark Keeper as a natural, emotional solution
	•	Feel magical, intelligent, premium, not corporate
	•	Convert visitors into “Coming Soon” waiters / early adopters

⸻

2. Core User Problem (What We Sell)

Problem Statement (must be clearly communicated early)

Modern people live in constant information overload:
	•	Ideas, thoughts, links, screenshots, voice notes
	•	Saved posts, bookmarks, recommendations, plans

But:
	•	Everything is scattered across apps
	•	Nothing is structured
	•	When the moment comes — we can’t find what matters

Real-life pain examples (to be used in copy & visuals)
	•	💡 “I saved a great place to visit… but where?”
→ bookmarks, Instagram saves, notes — all lost
	•	🎁 “My partner mentioned what they want all year… and I forgot.”
	•	🎬 “I have dozens of movie/series collections, but no idea what I watched.”
	•	📚 “I wanted to read that book / article — someday.”
	•	🧠 “Too many thoughts. Nothing turns into action.”

Core emotional pain:

“My thoughts are valuable, but they disappear.”

3. Solution (What Spark Keeper Is)

Spark Keeper is a single intelligent space where:
	•	You can send anything:
	•	text
	•	voice
	•	links
	•	images / screenshots
	•	At any moment, with zero friction

And AI:
	•	Understands the content
	•	Creates Sparks (structured knowledge units)
	•	Builds connections between ideas
	•	Suggests actions (tasks, reminders, calendar)
	•	Makes sure nothing important gets lost

Key message:

Capture once. Understand forever. Act when it matters.

4. Landing Page Structure (Block-by-Block)

⚠️ Important:
This structure is inspired by Penny Echo landing,
but design and visual style must be original.

Purpose: Emotional hook + value proposition

Content idea (not exact text):

	•	Subheadline about AI organizing everything for you
	•	Visual: glowing spark / coach presence / knowledge universe

⸻

4.2 Problem Deepening Section

Purpose: Make the user say “Yes, that’s me.”
